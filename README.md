# Game_Predictive_Analytics
I have done a General Analysis on a game called "World of WarFrame", where in dived deep in the Users purchasing pattern and power and the Vendor's performance and preferences, both regionally and over time as well.

# Tech Stakes Used:
1. Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2. SQL (SQL Server Management Studio)

# Problem Summary:
In the world of Warframe, players engage in transactions to acquire various in-game items using real-world money. These transactions are processed by different vendors, each taking a certain percentage of the revenue. One significant vendor, Vendor37, was temporarily closed on April 1st due to external circumstances. This analysis aims to determine whether it's beneficial to reopen Vendor37 or keep it closed, based on a comprehensive examination of the data.
